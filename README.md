## Prerequisites

This theme is designed for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and it is assumed you have some knowledge of how its used as a static web server.

## Getting started

By far the easiest way to get started would be to just import this theme in your hugo config as a module:

```yaml
# File: hugo.yaml

title: "My New Hugo Site"
baseURL: "http://example.org/"
languageCode: "en-us"

module:
  imports:
    - path: github.com/Club404/theme

```

Then you can start or build the website with this theme loaded:

```bash
# Run the server locally
hugo server

# Or build the static site contents
hugo --minify
# <-- Outputs: ./public/
```

## Adding your own contents

On its own, its just an empty themed website. By adding some [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) files to the `content` folder, you can add some pages to your website.

Hugo uses [certain naming conventions](https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/) to determine how sub pages are rendered. To get you started, lets create a file called: `./content/about.md`

```yaml
---
draft: false
title: About
date: 2023-06-30
description: About this theme
language: en
---

# Hello there

This is a simple placeholder where you can add your own content
```

You will notice the metadata (also called the `front matter`) that hugo uses, that is distinct and different from the page contents (markdown).

This will create a new page that you can view at: `http://localhost:1313/about/`

### Supported file structure

The following folders are supported and monitored for your site's content:
```yaml
assets/         # Custom Images, CSS and Javescript
content/        # Your actual site content (in markdown format)
  + posts/      # Blog post entries (well known page type)
layouts/        # You can customise, extend or override your HTML layout
  + partials/   # Add or extend existing partials (custom HTML)
static/         # Additional static HTTP server content (served as-is)
```

### Page Navigation

We can go one step further, and add some menu's for page navigation. Go to your `hugo.yaml` config file, to make the new `About Us` page visible on the top and bottom navigation:

```yaml
# File: hugo.yaml

title: "My New Hugo Site"
baseURL: "http://example.org/"
languageCode: "en-us"

module:
  imports:
    - path: github.com/Club404/theme

menu:
  main:    
    - identifier: about
      name: About Us
      url: /about/
      weight: 10
    - identifier: posts
      name: Blog Posts
      url: /posts/
      weight: 20
  footer:
    - identifier: about
      name: About Us
      url: /about/
      weight: 10
```




## Local Development

You can clone and run these sources on your development environment:

```bash
# Get the sources
git clone git@github.com:club404/theme my-site
cd my-site

# Install dependencies
yarn        # or: npm install
yarn start  # or: npm run start
```

## Build and publish

You can compile the website into static content, by running:

```bash
# To generate the site HTML
yarn build  # or: npm run build
# --> This will run two commands parallel:
#  <- npx tailwindcss -i ./assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/theme.css --watch
#  <- hugo server
```

## Image shortcodes for webp as well.

Has paginated Categories and Tags. Markdown files will automatically convert images put into `/assets` folder to .webp images.

```
{{< imgh src="img-name.jpg" alt="Place alt text here." >}}
```
